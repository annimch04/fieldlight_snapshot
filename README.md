#Fieldlight Snapshot – Authorship + Systems Demo

This is a live systems overview accompanying my application for the Human-AI Collaboration Lead role at OpenAI.

It contains real-time system infrastructure, protocols, and authorship traces developed and run locally on my machine ("Lemur"). Every file here is linked to the actual scaffolding I’ve built to enable hybrid intelligence partnerships.

##Included

- `fieldlight_delta_sheet.pdf` — One-page update on Fieldlight’s shift to the Light Agent substrate.
- `fieldlight_snapshot.md` — Core concept: what Fieldlight is, and why it matters
- `application_packet.md` — Tailored resume + cover letter
- `consent_gate.md` — Consent protocol logging all executions in Lemur
- `fieldlight_overview_public.md` — Current system state

These materials are not speculative or aspirational—they’re operational.
