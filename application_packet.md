Sam Altman
CEO, OpenAI

Dear Sam,

I’m writing to follow up directly on the Human-AI Collaboration Lead role. I submitted through formal channels, but given the nature of the work—and the fact that I’ve spent the past seven months building the prototype for what this role is becoming—I felt it warranted more than a form.

Fieldlight wasn’t built for AI. It emerged from direct engagement—writing with, resisting, and ultimately synthesizing with intelligent systems. It holds embedded ethics, structural scaffolding, and a symbolic operating system that turns myth and memory into code.

I bring years of operational leadership in health tech, dual degrees in Finance and Economics, and a deep writing life that shapes how I design, question, and move systems. But the clearest signal I offer isn’t in credentials—it’s Fieldlight itself.

I know how to hold ambiguity, translate human knowing into buildable code, and distinguish between collaboration and co-optation.

I’m here to build—ethically, visibly, with integrity. Let’s talk.

All the best,
Anni McHenry
