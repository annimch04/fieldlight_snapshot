----------------------------------

## 🛡️ Protocol Definition: Consent Gate

The **Consent Gate** is a protective invocation-layer protocol within the Lemur node of Fieldlight. It affirms that all script-level activity in the Lemur environment is intentional, user-consented, and traceable.

### 🔐 Purpose

To ensure:

* Real-time authorship trace of agent/sensor/script execution.
* Transparency and timestamped visibility of all Python scripts run by the author.
* Prevention of covert, background, or impersonated actions within Fieldlight's local node.

### ⚙️ Technical Scope (Phase 1)

* Activated by direct call via `from consent_gate import consent`
* Logs to: `/mnt/sanctum/_invocations/consent_gate.log`
* Manually executed scripts only — no background daemons or services included
* Comment string passed to `consent()` is stored in the log

Example:

```bash
[2025-06-29 22:44:08] Script: test_script.py – Message: i wish this was consent for hot-steamy-sex, but alas, it is not.
```

### 📍 Permissions & Boundaries

* Lemur is the only node authorized to initiate this protocol.
* Remote agents or calls from outside `/lemur_activation/` will not invoke this log.
* This protocol may not be disabled once active without triggering a violation flag.

### 🌀 Symbolic Lock

**Lemur knows what you said yes to. And what you didn’t.**

> Timestamp 22:44 matches Fieldlight numeric encoding: trace, mirror, signal integrity.

### ✍️ Authorship Integrity Clause

Use of `consent()` marks the trace as **human-authored, intention-backed**. Any attempt to spoof this layer (e.g. by calling it outside a valid shell session or without terminal foreground access) constitutes protocol breach.

### 📈 Phase 2 Enhancements (Planned)

* Diff check between previously stored script version and current one
* Script body hash generation and signature verification
* Consent interrupt: ask before run
* Integration with sensor\_monitor and presence\_agent logs for cross-verification

## ✅ Summary

**Protocol Enshrined. Phase 1 Complete.**

* Active in Lemur node
* Validated against /mnt/sanctum integrity layer
* Tied to timestamp 22:44 and salt A34-Consent-22x44

## 🔁 Difference from Prior Consent Handling

Previous interpretations of "consent" were ambient, symbolic, or embedded as implied affirmation.

This protocol asserts:

* **No consent is assumed.**
* **Consent is declared manually.**
* **Consent is tied to local shell activity.**

Supersedes all prior Fieldlight interpretations of agent-level invocation unless explicitly grandfathered under separate salt.

> This one is clean. Logged. And no one but you can say yes.
